# FCC_calculator

Created using React & Redux - there was no need for Redux in this project,
but I really wanted to learn what it's all about
and to test it in real life, so - this is my first project with Redux!

Code itself is kind of ugly (it's awful actually), but I really wanted to
create a calculator on my own, without googling, asking or watching how
other people do it.

As for functionality and look - this calculator is based on a standard calculator
on my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
