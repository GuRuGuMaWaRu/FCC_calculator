## FreeCodeCamp Front End Project - Build a JavaScript Calculator

## User Stories

- [ ] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- [ ] I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- [ ] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## Thoughts

It was the hardest and longest project among all, even today. There were several reasons for that - 1) took some time off, about two months I think, 2) wanted to implement a lot of cool calculator stuff, and 3) made it a rule not to google any solutions and answers. For the last part my reasoning was that I wanted to learn and not to copy, so I had to think myself how to make operator precedence work, how to make brackets work and how to deal with big or small numbers. There was really a lot of hard stuff! Anyway, I was very proud that in the end I managed to accomplish everything, and I still think that it is a great achievement for me.
